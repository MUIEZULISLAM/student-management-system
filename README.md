This project is a console-based Student Management System developed using Python with a strong focus on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) and file handling. It allows users to add, view, update, search, and delete student records while ensuring data persistence through a text file. The project demonstrates practical use of classes, objects, class methods, and safe file rewriting techniques to keep in-memory data synchronized with stored records. It was built to strengthen OOP fundamentals, improve logical thinking, and gain hands-on experience with real-world CRUD operations before moving on to advanced OOP concepts.
